# Edge System administration

The Edge System provides a number of administration level functions.

To reset the Edge System, use any REST client and make a request using one of the following:
```
Method: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/administration/System/Reset
Header: Content-Type application/json
```

Example using cURL:

```bash
curl -v -d "" -X POST http://localhost:5590/api/v1/Administration/System/Reset
```

An HTTP status 204 message indicates success.
