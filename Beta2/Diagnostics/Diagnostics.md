# Edge System Diagnostics

The Edge System and it's components produce diagnostics data which is stored locally in the Storage component and may be queried locally and/or egressed to PI Web API endpoints or the OSIsoft Cloud Services.

Diagnostics data is stored within the 'diagnostics' namespace of Edge Storage.  Local access to this data is available via the [Sds](xref:sdsReadingData) methods.

## Egressing diagnostics data via PeriodicEgressEndpoints

To egress diagnositcs related data, configure a periodic egress endpoint and specify ```diagnostics``` as the NamespaceId in the Periodic Egress Endpoint configuration.

## Diagnostics produced by the Edge System

The Edge System produces the following diagnostics streams:

The Diagnostics.System dynamic Type includes these values and are logged in a stream with the id System.Diagnostics.
This diagnostic stream contains system level information related to the host platform that the Edge System is running on.

| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp  | Timestamp of event  |
| int | ProcessIdentifier  | Process id of the host process  |
| string | StartTime  | When the host process started  |
| long | WorkingSet  | Amount of physical memory, in bytes, allocated for the host process  |
| double | TotalProcessorTime (uom=s)  | Total processor time for the host process expressed in seconds  |
| double | TotalUserProcessorTime (uom=s)  | User processor time for the host process expressed in seconds  |
| double | TotalPrivilegedProcessorTime (uom=s)  | Privileged processor time for the host process expressed in seconds  |
| int | ThreadCount | Number of threads in the host process |
| int | HandleCount  | Number of handles opened by the host process  |
| double | ManagedMemorySize (uom=MB)  | Number of bytes currently thought to be allocated in managed memory  |
| double | PrivateMemorySize (uom=MB)  | Amount of paged memory, in bytes, allocated for the host process  |
| double | PeakPagedMemorySize (uom=MB)  | Maximum amount of memory in the virtual memory paging file, in bytes, used by the host process.  |
| double | StorageTotalSize (uom=MB)  | Total size of the storage medium in use by the Edge System  |
| double | StorageFreeSpace (uom=MB)  | Free space available  |

## Edge Connectivity Components Diagnostics

Each connectivity component of the Edge System produces it's own diagnostics streams.

### Stream Count

The Diagnostics.StreamCountEvent dynamic type includes these values, and are logged in a stream with the id {componentid}.StreamCount.  The stream count and type count include only types and streams created for sequential data received from a data source.
| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp | Timestamp of event |
| int | StreamCount | Number of streams created by the adapter instance |
| int | TypeCount | Number of types created by the adapter instance |

### IO Rate

The Diagnostics.Adapter.IORate dynamic type includes these values, and are logged in a stream with the id {componentid}.IORate. IO rate includes only sequential data collected from a data source.

| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp | Timestamp of event |
| double | IORate | 10-minute rolling average of data rate (streams/second) |

### Error Rate

The Diganostics.Adapter.ErrorRate dynamic type includes these values, and are logged in a stream with the id {componentid}.ErrorRate.

| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp | Timestamp of event |
| double | ErrorRate | 10-minute rolling average of error rate (streams/second)

## Edge Storage Diagnostics

The Storage component of the Edge System produces the following diagnostics streams.

### Storage.default.default.Counts

The Storage.default.default.Counts stream includes counts of the types, streams and stream views of the default namespace.

| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp | Timestamp of event |
| integer | TypeCount | Count of types |
| integer | StreamCount | Count of streams |
| integer | StreamViewCount | Count of stream views |

### Storage.default.diagnostics.Counts

The Storage.default.default.Counts stream includes counts of the types, streams and stream views of the diagnostics namespace.

| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp | Timestamp of event |
| integer | TypeCount | Count of types |
| integer | StreamCount | Count of streams |
| integer | StreamViewCount | Count of stream views |

### Storage.Total.Counts

The Storage.Totals.Counts stream includes counts of the types, streams and stream views of all namespaces of the storage component.

| Type         | Property |  Description     |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| string | timestamp | Timestamp of event |
| integer | TypeCount | Count of types |
| integer | StreamCount | Count of streams |
| integer | StreamViewCount | Count of stream views |
