# Command Line Configuration of the Edge System

In some cases it is possible to configure the Edge System using the command line. For Beta 2 this capability has not been fully tested and it is recommended to use REST configuration instead. REST configuration is more secure and reliable, and does not require elevated or administrator privileges.
